GNotifier
=========

Add-on for Firefox. Integrates Firefox's notifications with the native 
notification system from Linux desktop. It supports: GNOME, KDE, Xfce 
and Unity.

Everytime when Firefox is finished downloading, it opens up the 
‘Downloads Complete’ pop-up window. GNotifier replaces these window 
with the native notification, depending on your Linux distribution.
